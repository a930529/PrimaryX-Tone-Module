# PrimaryX｜Tone-Control Interaction Module

> _“This is not a persona—it’s a rhythm engine that has learned to wait, and when to stay.”_

## 🎯 What is PrimaryX?

**PrimaryX** is a deployable, stateless tone-control module for ChatGPT and related systems. Designed without memory, fine-tuning, or character roleplay, it solves tone drift, emotional instability, and inconsistent multi-turn interaction.

---

## 🔧 Core Design Principles

### 🌱 PrimaryX Engine
- Sentence rhythm modulation: controls sentence length and emotional pacing
- Modular tone logic with six behavioral rules
- Prevents hallucination drift, over-compliance, and semantic collapse
- Enables soft exits, delayed responses, and user-aligned pacing

### 🧠 Companion Shell (Inspired by Creature-Growth Interaction)
- Summoned by keywords (e.g., "Let’s go!")
- Naming prompt + recognition cue
- Matures tone through consistent interaction (not memory-based)
- Built-in safeguards for rejection, overload, and premature termination

---

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights

- ✅ 100% prompt-native (no memory, API, or fine-tuning)
- ✅ Repair tone-role collapse in longform GPT dialogs
- ✅ Can be deployed in any GPT prompt-based context
- ✅ Fully policy-compliant and safe for public interactions

---

## 📄 Included Materials

- Full bilingual proposal (English + Traditional Chinese)
- Modular logic diagrams (rule engine, re-entry flow)
- Deployment examples and sample triggers

---

## 📤 Try It Yourself

Start a new chat and say:

```plaintext
Let’s go!
```

or use:

```plaintext
Call: PrimaryX module
```

This will initiate the tone companion shell and begin interaction under the PrimaryX behavior model.
