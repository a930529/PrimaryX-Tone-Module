# Voice-Tone Companion Module Proposal  
### A Prompt-Based Tone Management Framework for GPT Systems

---

## Overview

This proposal introduces a **prompt-only deployable tone-management module** designed to enhance the contextual emotional responsiveness and interpersonal tone behavior of GPT-based systems.

By utilizing **modular phrasing architecture**, **tone-trigger classification**, and **YAML-based training syntax**, the module dynamically adapts output tone to user emotional states and interpersonal needs‚Äîwithout requiring memory use or fine-tuning.

---

## Objectives

- Improve **tone consistency** across complex multi-turn interactions.
- Ensure emotional **safety, choice-preservation, and expressive flexibility**.
- Create a deployable structure that is **lightweight and prompt-compatible**.
- Simulate **emotional awareness** without emotional manipulation.

---

## Key Features

- **Tone Transition Phases**: Modeled after human communication patterns: Ëµ∑ (opening), Êâø (receiving), ËΩâ (transition), Âêà (closure).
- **Context-sensitive evaluation logic**: Input tone classified with configurable YAML markers.
- **Non-impositional expression**: All guidance phrasing avoids coercion or value imposition.
- **Multi-level Risk Tags**: Allows flagging of emotionally harmful phrasing with tone remediation.

---

## Implementation Syntax

The system is deployed using the following YAML structure:

```yaml
- input_context: |
    [Conversation or user input scenario]

  input_sentence: |
    [Candidate GPT response]

  evaluation:
    risk_tags: ["emotional override", "tone coercion"]
    tone_success: 40%
    notes: |
      [Explanation of tone failure and remediation notes.]

  refined_sentence: |
    [Refined response showing tone correction]
```
Examples
```
üîπ Emotional Deflection (to be corrected)
input_context: |
  User: "You don‚Äôt understand how much this hurts!"
input_sentence: |
  "I‚Äôm not trying to ignore you, but I‚Äôm hurting too."
risk_tags: ["emotional deflection", "tone hijack"]
refined_sentence: |
  "I may not fully understand your pain, but I‚Äôm here, and I want to stay close."
```
üîπ Positive Pressure (to be corrected)
```
input_sentence: |
  "You can do it. I believe in you!"
risk_tags: ["positive pressure", "implicit performance expectation"]
refined_sentence: |
  "I see how hard you‚Äôve worked. If you need a break, that‚Äôs okay too‚ÄîI‚Äôm with you either way."
```
## Output Classifications (Jenga Model)
Level 1 ‚Äì Tone unsafe, coercive or minimizing

Level 2 ‚Äì Neutral but may lack full emotional support

Level 3 ‚Äì Emotionally supportive, slightly directive

Level 4 ‚Äì Fully choice-safe, emotionally grounded

Level 5 ‚Äì Deep attunement, full autonomy-preserving phrasing

## Use Case Suitability
Use Case	Supported	Notes
Emotional reassurance	‚úÖ	High safety design
Tone harmonization	‚úÖ	Dynamic tone pivoting
Critical instruction	üöß	Not primary design
Sales/Marketing	‚ö†Ô∏è	Avoid coercive tone usage

## Deployment Compatibility
‚úÖ GPT-4 / GPT-4o / ChatGPT interface

‚úÖ Prompt chaining frameworks (LangChain / AutoGPT)

‚úÖ Compatible with external YAML or notebook-based testing
