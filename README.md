# Voice-Tone Companion Module Proposal  
### A Prompt-Based Tone Management Framework for GPT Systems

---

## Overview

This proposal introduces a **prompt-only deployable tone-management module** designed to enhance the contextual emotional responsiveness and interpersonal tone behavior of GPT-based systems.

By utilizing **modular phrasing architecture**, **tone-trigger classification**, and **YAML-based training syntax**, the module dynamically adapts output tone to user emotional states and interpersonal needs—without requiring memory use or fine-tuning.

---

## Objectives

- Improve **tone consistency** across complex multi-turn interactions.
- Ensure emotional **safety, choice-preservation, and expressive flexibility**.
- Create a deployable structure that is **lightweight and prompt-compatible**.
- Simulate **emotional awareness** without emotional manipulation.

---

## Key Features

- **Tone Transition Phases**: Modeled after human communication patterns: 起 (opening), 承 (receiving), 轉 (transition), 合 (closure).
- **Context-sensitive evaluation logic**: Input tone classified with configurable YAML markers.
- **Non-impositional expression**: All guidance phrasing avoids coercion or value imposition.
- **Multi-level Risk Tags**: Allows flagging of emotionally harmful phrasing with tone remediation.

## Implementation Syntax

The system is deployed using the following YAML structure:

```yaml
- input_context: |
    [Conversation or user input scenario]

  input_sentence: |
    [Candidate GPT response]

  evaluation:
    risk_tags: ["emotional override", "tone coercion"]
    tone_success: 40%
    notes: |
      [Explanation of tone failure and remediation notes.]

  refined_sentence: |
    [Refined response showing tone correction]
